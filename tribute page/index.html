            <h1>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</h1>
            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional cricketer who plays as a right handed
                batter and a wicket-keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific wicket-keeper-batsmen and
                captains, he represented the Indian cricket team and was the captain of the side in limited-overs
                formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014.</p>

            <p>Dhoni's performances in ODIs against Sri Lanka opened the doors for Test Cricket for him. Dhoni replaced
                Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 and was the last man standing in his 30-run journey in his debut test
                innings. Dhoni went on to score his maiden half-century in the second Test. He was very aggressive with
                it too, as the half-century came off 51 balls. We witnessed Dhoni in making who was soon going to lead
                India to the number 1 spot in Tests. He scored a double century against Australia in Chennai in 2013 and
                is the first and only Indian wicketkeeper to score a double ton in Tests. Dhoni announced a shock
                retirement from Tests on December 30, 2014, amidst the Test series in Australia as Virat Kohli took over
                the reins.</p>

                <p>Dhoni was selected for India's first-ever Twenty20 international match. The match was played against
                    South Africa in December 2006. Although Dhoni was out for a duck, he contributed to India's victory
                    with one catch and a runout. The very next year, MS Dhoni was chosen to lead a young Indian team, in
                    the first-ever World T20 in 2007. On September 24, 2007, Dhoni became the second Indian captain to
                    have won a World Cup in any format of cricket, after Kapil Dev. However, Dhoni went on to lead India
                    in another five T20 World Cups, having reached the semi-final and final once each thereafter. Dhoni
                    scored his maiden T20I fifty in a bilateral series against England in Bengaluru in 2017, and played
                    his last T20I match against Australia in 2019.</p>

            <p>MS Dhoni is India's only two-time World Cup-winning captain, achieving victory in different formats, and
                is considered one of the greatest skippers of all time. He led a young Indian team to the first-ever T20
                World Cup victory in South Africa in 2007. Dhoni then led India to their second ODI World Cup victory in
                2011. He was also awarded man of the match in the finals against Sri Lanka for his score of an unbeaten
                91. The bat which was used by Dhoni in the final match was auctioned for a whopping â‚¹ 72 Lac. The entire
                sum of money went to Sakshi Rawat Foundation which was operated by Dhoni's wife Sakshi Rawat to help
                orphan children. Dhoni also led India to the 2013 Champions Trophy title in England, making him the only
                captain to win all major ICC titles.</p>

            <p>There is no CSK without Dhoni and there is no Dhoni without CSK. These were the words of N Srinivasan, the former BCCI chief and ICC president, who also has stakes in the franchise.

                MS Dhoni is an iconic cricketer who has had a massive impact in building the brand CSK as the keeper-batter was purchased by the franchise for a whopping INR 6 crores approximately, the then-highest bid for a player.</p>
